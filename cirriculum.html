                <h1>Class Cirriculum</h1>

                <p>Electron Control teaches students the fundementals about computer engineering. Students use breadboards&mdash;boards that can be used to make electrical connections without the need to solder&mdash;to make circuits ranging from fundemental to complex. Students are briefly taught how a tool is used and how it works before being left to experiment on their own.</p>
                <p>Each week a specific topic is chosen and students build up to that topic over the course of the week. Towards the end of the week the topic will hit its "peak," and students will have made something new themselves. While students are mostly left to their own devices, the professor, Dr. Gardner, is constantly walking around the room checking on students and helping those that need assistance. So students are never fully in the dark about what to do.</p>

            <div class="week">
                <h2>Week 1</h2>

                <p>In the first week, students are taught the absolute basics of circuitry. No prerequisite knowledge is required or expected, so the class has to start somewhere. Students learn the basics of a breadboard, how connections are made internally and how to use wires to connect certain things together. Students are then shown how LEDs and light bulbs can be added as new components to a circuit. Students learn how to read and write circuit diagrams as well as how to translate them into breadboard connections. They are given some sample circuits to build on a breadboard themselves to learn the ways of architecture in circuitry.</p>
                <p>Once students are comfortable with circuit diagrams, wiring, and lights, Dr. Gardner move onto teaching some more fundamental components, such as the resistor and push button. Students learn how resistors work, learn about parallel and series circuits, and learn how voltage is distributed along resisted wires. Then students begin to use transistors, creating automatic circuits and simple logic gates by hand. First students create a NOT gate, then a follower, and then get into more complicated gates such as OR, AND, NAND, and NOR. To end the week off, the peak of the week is when students use nothing but transistors, wires, resistors, and buttons to make an XOR gate from scratch.</p>

            <div class="week">
                <h2>Week 2</h2>

                <p>The second week starts off by introducing IC&mdash;which stands for Integrated Circuit&mdash;chips, which are tiny chips that can do operations the students just made. Students are taught the Do's and Dont's when it comes to handling chips, including how to insert and remove them from a breadboard and grounding themselves to remove static charge before touching the chips. The students also build a Darlington Amplifier and shown how similar effects are present when connecting power directly to a chip without resisting it first. Students then create a test bed to debug and test chips they are given, and use the chips to make new circuits.</p>
                <p>Once students are ready, Dr. Gardner begins to talk about binary numbers and binary addition. Students learn how to interpret binary numbers, how to make negative binary numbers using Two's Compliment, and how to add and apply other operations to binary digits. Towards the end of the week, students are tasked with creating a 1-bit adder using two XOR gates and an AND gate. The students create a truth table for addition and create a circuit that will add two bits together as well as an additional carry bit. When students complete their board, they have the opportunity to go above and beyond by linking their 1-bit adder to another person's adder, creating a 2-bit adder. This year, students ended up in two groups of 9 boards, creating a mega-circuit that can add two nine-bit numbers together.</p>
                <p>Once students have finished their one-bit adder, they are once again introduced to a chip that will do it for them. They are introduced to a 4-bit addition chip, which can add two 4-bit numbers together, as well as a Multiplexer chip, which allows electronics to select between multiple input wires. Students are now tasked with a fairly large project, creating a primitive Arithmetic Logic Unit, or ALU. For one, they need to be able to add two 4-bit numbers together, but the ALU also needs to be able to subtract, NAND, and OR the two numbers together. The answer should be multiplexed and chosen by a 2-bit number. This is the second week's peak. And again, once students get to this point, they have the option to link their boards with other students to create a larger circuit.</p>

            <div class="week">
                <h2>Week 3</h2>
                
                <p>Once students have mastered chips and binary numbers, they are taught about some more tools, including the potentiometer, diode, and most importantly, capacitor. Students learn how capacitors store charge temorarily and release it afterwards. Students use their knowledge of capacitors and resistors to create a basic clock circuit, called an Astable Multivibrator. Once students get a hang of that, they are introduced to a clock chip that does some of it for them. Students are also introduced to the D-Flip-Flop chip, a circuit that will store data inside itself indefinitely while power is given to the chip.</p>
                <p>This is when the class has a change of pace. Dr. Gardner brings everybody out into a seperate room, along with many very large capacitors and two power supplies. He links the two power supplies in tandom with each other and links each capacitor together as well, and then increases the voltage and max amperage of the power supplies as high as they will go. He then has a student discharge the capacitors by pressing on the capacitors with a sheet of aluminum foil. Students are shown just how powerful electricity and capacitors are, though this activity is mostly just for fun.</p>
                <p>The last tool students are introduced to is the Shift Register, another chip that will shift the data inside of itself over by one bit. Now, they use their newfound knowledge to begin work on their third project: a so-called "Mousetrap Game," in which a light bulb is shifted over 16 bits and then loops back to the initial bit to begin shifting again. This looping will go on forever and is controlled by the clock circuit's speed, up until the student hits the stop button, when the lightbulb will stop moving. The goal is to have the active bulb (the "mouse") land on a specific light bulb, one glowing a different color than the rest. This is the peak of the third week.</p>

                <h2>Week 4</h2>

                <p>School is nearing the end, and that means it's final project time. But before that there's one last experiment students have: to make sounds using a speaker connected to a clock circuit. The goal is to teach students about frequencies and how fast the clock circuit can get. After that, students are given a sheet with many different topics on it and told to make some of them. Students don't have to only pick from the list, however, and Dr. Gardner is generally okay with new ideas a student comes up with. Students have entire rest of the week to work on those projects they chose, and while it is considerably more difficult than anything in the month prior, it's still entertaining and interesting to do.</p>
                <p>While students are working on their chosen projects, Dr. Gardner will pull some of them out of class to teach them soldering. Students are initially given a demonstration by Dr. Gardner, and then they are given their own soldering iron and a soldering kit they chose and are left to themselves. The soldering projects usually take about 1 class period total to complete, and afterwards they continue on their final project.</p>
