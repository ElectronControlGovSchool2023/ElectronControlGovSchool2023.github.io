                <p>Electron Control is a very hands-on class, likely more hands-on than most other MST SRGS classes. The class is focused mostly on electrical and computer engineering, with students using breadboards to create circuits without the need to soldier. This class requires no prerequisite knowledge, just the ability to learn new subjects decently quickly.</p>

                <p>Each week of the class is split into a specific topic. Students will learn new skills which are pertinent to the topic and will build up to a particular "peak" day. The topics build upon each other and as the weeks pass a student will learn more difficult material at an exponential rate. Yet it doesn't feel hopeless by any means as Dr. Gardner, the professor of Electron Control, is constantly moving about the room assisting anyone who needs it.</p>

                <h2>Week 1</h2>

                <p>In the first week, a student will learn the very basic fundamentals behind electronic circuitry. They will be introduced to a breadboard and learn how it functions. Dr. Gardner will then introduce LEDs and incandescent light bulbs as components that can be used in a circuit, as well as how to operate the power supply. Dr. Gardner will teach students how to read and write circuit diagrams and translate them into circuits constructed on a breadboard. Etc. Etc.</p>
